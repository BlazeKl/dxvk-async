# What?
A **gross hack** to use discard shaders while waiting for real shaders to compile asynchronously. This "solves" shader compilation stutter, with the downside of graphical glitches. Depends heavily on what the game does with the shaders: could work on some games fine and others will be horribly broken.


### Games tested
* Path of Exile: seems fine
* Overwatch: graphic bugs on first matches, seems fine after playing for a while


### Instructions

* patch dxvk with pipeline.patch
* Set env variables:
  * DXVK_USE_PIPECOMPILER=1
  * DXVK_USE_PLACEHOLDER_SHADERS=1
